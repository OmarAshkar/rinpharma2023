# RinPharma 2023 Visualization Workshop Material

## Description
Visualization is the butter and bread of data exploration and reporting. Unlike other domains, pharmaceutical analysis requires accurate and versatile plots due to the necessity of gaining a mechanistic understanding of the data. R ggplot2 package, R package built on top of grid system, has provided modelers and analysts with a flexible, modular way to generate almost any customized plots with ease. As ggplot2 grows over time, the R packages ecosystem built on top of ggplot2 has exponentially increased. Additionally, R plotly, an interactive visualization package wrapping JavaScript backend, provides a compelling interactivity to scrutinize the data to the max. By crafting compelling figures, we can unveil hidden patterns, accelerate decision-making and empower informed actions. As R is a strongly functional programming language, coupling ggplot2 and plotly with map functions from purrr, R package specialized for functional programming, provides a superb experience for users. 

## Objective 
This workshop aims to provide enough examples and hands-on exercises of advanced visualization workflow in R.
